All inductive experiments were conducted on a university-managed HPC compute
node under a single-GPU configuration. Unless otherwise specified, each run reserved
8 CPU cores, 64 GB RAM, and 1 GPU, with a maximum walltime of 4 hours per job.
The system used the supported a software stack with Jupyter, PyTorch 3, and CUDA,
and computations ran on AVX-512 capable CPUs.
