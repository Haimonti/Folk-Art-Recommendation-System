Rahuti asked a woodcutter to cleave the tree half-way through its trunk, and then went and hid, awaiting the rhino.

By virtue of many lives, Him I have won.  I Am Buried In Shyam Whatever the elders at home may say I can never leave my treasure, my Shyam, His beauty and charm have eaten my heart. I constantly fear that someone will come And cut my ribs open to take them away. Forever I am conscious, awake day and night, Even when in lassitude I close my eyes. I am buried in Shyam, the shape of my loves.  Who could ever wish me to leave my loving, I would rather eat poison than hear such words. I have explored his beauty and found no shores, But the god at last is standing by me. I will fulfill my dream and let the rest go.  The Confidante Loquitur That gay one who is the abode of virtue Incessantly murmurs thy name, On hearing a word of thee His limbs are pervaded by a thrill, Bending down lowly his head Tears pour from his eyes, If one should ask him a word He waves (him) away with his hand, If one should speak concerning thee Thou wilt see there is nothing else in his mind. There is no firmness (left) in him; A serious matter Chandi Das sings.  The Confidante Loquitur Ah lady! ah lady! hear a word, At length having seen (him) I have come again; Looking, looking, (my) pain increased, Whatever was done profited not. He binds not his hair, he girds not his waist, He eats not food, he drinks not water. The color of gold Shyam has become, Constantly remembering thy name. He does not recognize any one, his eye does not wink, He remains with fixed look like a doll of wood. I placed a piece of wool to his nose, Then only I perceived that he breathed, There is breath, but there remains no life, Delay not, my happiness depends on it! Chandi Das saith (it is) the anguish of separation In his heart, the only medicine is Radha.  Appeal Thy youth is but a noon, of night take heed, — A noon that is a fragment of a day, And the swift eve all sweet things bears away, All sweet things and all bitter, rose and weed. For others' bliss who lives, he lives indeed. But thou art pitiful and ruth shouldst know. I bid thee trifle not with fatal love, But save our pride and dear one, O my dove, And heaven and earth and the nether world below Shall only with thy praises peopled grow. Life is a bliss that cannot long abide, But while thou livest, love. For love the sky Was founded, earth upheaved from the deep cry Of waters, and by love is sweetly tied The golden cordage of our youth and pride."
